# This programme 
# 1) reads the list of compositions in ICSD,
# where oxidation states are specified
# 2) and extracts a training set of phase fields:
#    binaries
#    ternaries
#    quaternaries
#    etc. with the specified ox. states
# 3) AE, VAE and other models can be trained on the training set
# for detection of the outliers in the training and testing sets
# and ranking the unexplored phase fields of choice in terms of the degree
# of 'outlying' (degree = reconstruction error). That is hypothesised to 
# correlate with similarity with the 'known' phase fields, and hence,
# with the likelihood of forming a stable composition within a phase field.
